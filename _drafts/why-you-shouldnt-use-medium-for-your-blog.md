Clickbait articles, hyperbolic statements, fresh graduates from 4 month code camps that declare that all current programming languages are dead, painfully un-subtle product plugs. medium.com articles are everywhere now, and not a day goes by where at least two or three of the damned things show up on the front page of Hacker News or any other site with collections of programming articles. They have become formulaic to the point of parody, and I think you are doing yourself a disservice as a tech/programming blogger by hitching your wagon to the sleek green and white machine. They are often a platform for people who have a lot to say on twitter, but very little substance to write actually useful articles.

I know, it is hypocritical to slam content-less clickbait articles with a clickbait-y article of my own, but there is a point. I'll try to stop here with the actual bashing of medium and go into some real pros and cons of running your own blog vs. hosting on medium.com.

## Pros

I understand the appeal of medium, and before it came around, there was a lot fewer centralized blogging platforms that were so well *executed*. I've considered switching to it in the past, as I have considered switching to [ghost]() for much the same reasons, and that main reason is laziness. You have to admit the articles look sleek, and the markdown editor built in is very easy to use and produces great results.

pros

- nice clean design
- decent text editor
- easier to share "reach" others through recommended articles etc
- easy to make "publications" that have a variety of authors

cons

- everyone has the same design, it is not unique
- when i go to look up an article I've read, the first thing I do is scan the website and if it looks the same it will jog my memory
- it's a great learning experience to host your own blog and write your own theme/style
- no easy way to export all articles (citation needed)
- no easy way for RSS? (citation needed)
- can you point your own domain to medium?
- never remember the names of the articles or the authors. the author is a side-note in medium. with your blog, it's you, it's you front and center
- can't put ads/monetization on medium (citation needed)
