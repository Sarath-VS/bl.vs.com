I’m Sarath Sasindrakumar, and I’m a full stack software engineer based in Chennai, India. I primarily enjoy working with Java and JavaScript but I’m always seeking ways to expand my knowledge and learn about new tools, languages and frameworks.

You can contact me via email at sarathvss65@gmail.com or hit me up on twitter [@SarathVS65](http://twitter.com/SarathVS65)! You can also check out my GitHub profile {% include icon-github.html username="netooran" %}, or my [StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5850662/sarath-vs).

In addition to software development, my other loves include reading, writing, music, cycling, hiking, travelling!
